                The world of Kismet was a happy and peaceful realm, teeming with lushful nature and a multitude of wondrous magical phenomena that provided its inhabitants with endless opportunities.
                <br></br><br></br>
                The inhabitants of Kismet were at a mutual peace with the many magical creatures throughout their realm and life was supported by the coexistence of humanity and these powerful creatures. Though life was not all perfect, it was mostly devoid of conflict and promoted prosperity.
                <br></br><br></br>
                The realm of Kismet was ruled by a great and benevolent king by the name of Kitiman. Kitiman was a great king that loved all his people, constantly seeking ways to do better by them and provide his people the best possible opportunities a kingdom as grand as Kismet could offer. The King swore off all violence in order to promote peace among his people and he truly believed that if he was peacefully and just king, that this peace would truly last forever. However, good things always seem to turn bad eventually.

                On a seemingly regular day in the kingdom of Kismet, the sky began to be covered by a dark smoke that overcasted the kingdom, suffocating the light out of it. In a far distance a large army of battle born troops was seen approaching the Castle of Kismet ferociously. At the foot of their march lead their great yet terrible leader, The Great Demonic Warlord Kaus they called him. A seemingly slim yet imposing character dressed in black samurai armour, accented with red, possibly metallic or blood, completed with a tattered red cape. The warlord's infamous weapon was a long sleek black katana with a red edge, stained from all the blood it had surely tasted, with its hilt having a black chain attached to it. His presence was almost seemingly inhuman and demonic, with voidless red eyes that seemed to devour the very sight of anything that laid in their sights.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Kaus' army stormed the Castle of Kismet leaving no survivors in his wake. As Kaus slowly ascends the stairs leading to the throne, he reaches the apex of the stairs and stands before the king declaring, “It seems this world has forgotten how to fight for itself.”  “Who are you?" The king questions, “Me,  I am simply just a reminder to wake up from the fantasy you live in.” Kaus growls. Kaus then without any hesitation or warning, unsheathes his katana and cuts the king down, and even though his face was fully covered, the king could feel that Kaus was smiling, loving every minute of trampling on his perfect peace.
                <br></br><br></br>
                The arrival of Kaus has caused the once peaceful magical world to become unstable and violent, with once calm magical beasts now spreading throughout the land causing chaos. The kingdom of Kismet is in need of a Legendary hero to save them from this chaos, can you be the hero they are looking for?

                “Of course you lost, and it’s not like you aren’t a talented or capable fighter, the only reason that you're worse than me is that you just simply weren't born as me.”
                <br></br><br></br>
                The Ninja was a great and proud fighter, descended from a lineage of great warriors. While he truly was a talented combatant, he often let his talent get to his head. One day, the Ninja’s village was invaded by Kaus and his army. He watched as Kaus tore through the people he respected and cherished, he then laid his eyes on the ninja next. Though the Ninja tried everything to defeat Kaus, he was simply unstoppable and completely dismantled the Ninja. On the verge of death, the Ninja experienced true despair at the experience of discovering there was someone so much more powerful than himself. For the first time in the Ninja’s he had felt fear dealt to him at the hands of a superior opponent, and fled his village. Now with a broken pride and a broken heart, the Ninja swears to grow in strength and defeat Kaus.

                “I will live the rest of my life making up for what I blindly believed was justified, I refuse to die holding onto my sins, I refuse to die a monster!”
                <br></br><br></br>
                The Knight was once a simple foot soldier in the original army that stormed the Castle of Kismet. Although the Knight strangely had no memories of his past or previous wars he had fought for Kaus, he was certain that his thirst for battle was unquenchable and would always down any warrior, but everything changed for the Knight the day he stormed the Castle of Kismet. As they rode through Kismet, the Knight watched the slaughtering, not of soldiers, but of innocents. This stirred something deep within the Knight and resulted in him rebelling against his squad captain. Though his squad captain was the more talented fighter of the two, the Knight’s sheer will resulted in his victory, though at the cost of his eye. The Knight now wears his scarred helmet as a reminder of his past sins.

                “Life’s all about having fun and smiling, and if ya aint smilin’, ya aint livin’ ya life!”
                <br></br><br></br>
                The Jester was a happy orphan that was taken in and raised by the kind king Kitiman. As the Jester grew, her admiration for her adoptive father grew. This admiration and pure joy reached the point to which all the Jester wanted was for the king to be happy. Thus began the Jester’s profession as well… The King’s Jester! The Jester would always keep the king smiling and happy, and she found happiness in this too, until she couldn’t make him smile anymore. On the day Kaus reached the king’s throne room, the kind king led the Jester to a secret passageway behind the throne wall. The Jester watched through a crack in the wall as Kaus sliced the king in two. Terrified for her life, she fled the castle and swore that one day she would get the last laugh.

                “The whole kingdom of Kismet needs me to be fearless and master my abilities in order to save it from darkness, but how can they expect me to be fearless when I’m so afraid.”

                The Mage is a young girl capable of so much potential that she could not dare to imagine. She often spends her time reading in the library in her village of wizards about great, grand adventures of glorious heroes, knowing well that she thought she was no glorious person. One day, while she is simply reading a book in the library, she hears a loud commotion occurring outside. Outside awaited her the horror of a slaughter that no child deserved to witness, and she immediately curled up into a ball and started yelling. Although her hearing was faint, she heard someone approaching her. She looks up and sees a dark figure staring at her with red demonic eyes, it was Kaus. She then blasts Kaus with a powerful spell instinctively out of fear, slamming him to the side of the building and collapsing its walls on him. The little Mage then starts running as fast as her legs can carry her, away from that scary and terrifying place. The Mage thinks to herself that this isn’t how she wanted to start an adventure, but that she must now go on this adventure for the sake of Kismet.
